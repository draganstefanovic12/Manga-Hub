# Manga-site

Manga reading site created in React using MangaDEX API. I wanted to practice react and decided to build my own manga reading site. You can see manga authors, read chapters and search mangas with tags. 

There is no live project now because MangaDEX servers don't allow domain to domain fetching in order to protect the users and to protect people from trying to make manga reading sites filled with ads to try to cash in. 

I have a few images that serve like a preview of what the project looks like:

I plan on implementing filtering out by multiple genres and by manga status (ongoing, completed) but for now this is the finished product.
