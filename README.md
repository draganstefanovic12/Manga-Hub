# Manga-site

Manga reading site created in React using MangaDEX API. I wanted to practice react and decided to build my own manga reading site. You can see manga authors, read chapters and search mangas with tags. 

The app isn't live because MangaDEX doesn't have CORS enabled and they block previews if I try to write my own proxy.

I have a few images that serve like a preview of what the project looks like:
